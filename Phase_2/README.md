# AutoMeet - Implementation Phase

The files in this directory provides the technical side of the implementation phase. The implementation includes two parts: dataset processing and video editing. The dataset is collected from two sources: 8K of soccer game images was collected from Kaggle, while 1K of the dataset was collected by the team from a local soccer game in Saudi Arabia. The dataset is manually annotated by the team members to prepare it for the clock classification model.
