# AutoMeet - Implementation Phase

The files in this directory provides the fundamental method behind AutoMeet. The implementation includes two main parts: event extraction using AI method and video editing. The dataset is collected from two sources: 8K of soccer game images was collected from Kaggle, while 1K of the dataset was collected by the team from a local soccer game in Saudi Arabia. The dataset is manually annotated by the team members to prepare it for the clock classification and recognition models. The extracted events are saved as separate videos that could be merged together to produce the desired montage.
