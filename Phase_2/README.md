# AutoMeet - Implementation Phase

The files in this directory demonstrate the fundamental technology behind AutoMeet. The implementation includes two main parts: event extraction using AI technology and video editing. The dataset is collected from two sources: 8K of soccer game images was collected from Kaggle, while 1K of the dataset was collected by the team from a local soccer games in Saudi Arabia. The dataset is manually annotated by the team members to prepare it for the clock classification and recognition models. The extracted events are saved as separate videos that are merged to produce the desired montage. All extracted images and videos could be used later for building a Saudi soccer dataset.
